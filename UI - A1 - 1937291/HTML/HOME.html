                <p>
                    We've been interested in setting up a Hackathon! While the details aren't finalized; we hope that other schools will be able to partake in the Hackathon in efforts to expose ourselves to the creativity of others. As of right now; we plan on hosting the event in the library in April. As for teams, all are welcome! (Maximum of 4 per team...)
